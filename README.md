# ✈️ Delta Airlines Future Traffic Forecasting (LSTM Model)

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to forecast passenger traffic for **Delta Airlines** using historical data from 1990 to 2024.

It analyzes seasonal trends, detect patterns, and predict traffic for the next 12 months(2025).

---

## 📊 Dataset

The data comes from the U.S. Airline Traffic Statistics dataset and includes:
- Airline name
- Traffic type (passenger, freight, etc.)
- Scheduled vs charter flights
- Years (1990–2024)
- and many more

---

## Machine Learning Model

We used a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) to:
- Capture long-term trends and seasonality
- Forecast 12 months of traffic based on previous values

Steps:
1. Data cleaning and monthly aggregation
2. Scaling with `MinMaxScaler`
3. Sequence creation for time-series modeling
4. LSTM model built using TensorFlow
5. Forecast generation and plotting
